# AliTools-for-Aliexpress-API
AliTools public API (under development). 

Alitools is a browser extension aimed to help its users monitor price changes for products, indicate seller trust levels, search products and read real reviews and track parcels on AliExpress. 

The data gathered via extension reflects buyers interest. We have information about 198 700 sellers, 55 000 000 products. Near 460 000 products are visited by our users daily. We know over 3 million products which were visited by AliTools users at least twice. AliTools API is going to enable eCommerce businesses to benefit from this knowledge. 

The data will be available by monthly subscription, plans will differ according to the data volume. There are also real-time and historical data options. At the moment the API is under development, but we can provide a test dataset.

# First step will be a partner API available only restricted group of users. This is needed to test API usability, check if our formatting rules are consistent enough, if our data is reach enough to be valuable for potential customers. Write me in case you are interested in getting the partner access. My e-mail: alina.radachynskaja@bdtech.by
